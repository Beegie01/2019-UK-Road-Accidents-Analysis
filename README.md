# 2019-UK-Road-Accidents-Analysis
This is my analysis of 2019 road accidents in the UK. Data (downloaded from the official Uk government website gov.uk) were in separate accidents, vehicles, and casualties CSV files, as well as variable lookup XLS files.
Overall goal was to provide government agencies with recommendations on measures of preventing future road accidents. It involved data cleaning, feature engineering, correlation analysis, association mining, inferential statistics, and recommendation.
